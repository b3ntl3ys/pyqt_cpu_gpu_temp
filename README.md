# pyqt_cpu_gpu_temp
This is a simple program that monitors the temperature of your CPU and GPU.
You can drag the temperature display around by holding down the left mouse button on the font.
To close the program, right-click on the font to bring up the close menu.

I have tried to keep it as simple as possible, but I may add more features in the future.
